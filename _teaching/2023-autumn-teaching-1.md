This is a course on design of experiments, linear mixed models and blocked experiments.

This course covers the following

Multiple linear regression
------
* Coeeficient estimations
* Confidence intervals
* Prediction intervals
* Hypothesis testing (T-test and F-tests)
* Variance inflation factors
* Model selection and diagnostic tools
* Outlier detection

Mixed models
------
* Data analysis with blocking factors modeled as random effects
* Random intercept models

Design of experiments
------
* Classical designs: full-factorial and fractional-factorial designs
* Response surface designs
* Screening designs
* Optimal designs: D- and I-optimality
* Design augmentation
* Balanced complete and incomplete block designs
* Row-column designs (eg: Latin square designs)
* Response optimization for robustness experiments
